			<h1>Mysterious Instructions</h1>
			<p>All around the city of Wellington there are instructions spray painted on the ground. It's nearly impossible to decifer what they might mean. I find it very interesting that there are such obvious markings in such public places that none of us understand. </p>

				<h3>NZSS Circle</h3>
				<p>I'm guessing that in this example the NZ stands for New Zealand and I'm going with the SS standing for sewer system. The circle is around some sort green spot that possibly indicates where something is under the concrete?</p>

				<h3>Dop</h3>
				<p>I'm thinking that in thi one Dop may stand for some kind of procedure or way of doing something. I saw the same symbol in other places but without the letters next to it so perhaps this is a different version of a more common thing.</p>

				<h3>1*SL etc.</h3>
				<p>This one is pretty interesting because I had seen all these individual components in other places but this time they're all being used together. The lines with the other three little lines coming off the side is especially common.</p>

		<h1>Manhole Covers and Similar</h1>
		<p>Another feature of so many towns and cities that we all rarely pay much attention to is the many metal cover things. Once again most of us have no idea what many of these are used for though we pass them every day. </p>

				<h3>WELLINGTON CITY COUNCIL WATER SUPPLY</h3>
				<p>This one is pretty easy to interprate as it has a pretty clear titile. I usually associate water works with your traditional circular manhole cover and I'm curious what the difference is between those and these little square ones. </p>

				<h3>WCC</h3>
				<p>Up close this may look like your typical circular manhole cover but it's actually very small. The letters WCC probably stand for wellington city council. It's interesting that our last example was so clearly labled where this one goes back to a simple acronym.</p>

				<h3>FH</h3>
				<p>This one I'm really not sure about. What could the FH stand for? Maybe fire hazard? And why is it painted yellow? Maybe because it's a fire hazard...</p>

		<h1>Pipes</h1>
		<p>The mystery continues with all the pipes one sees along the sides of buildings. I'm assuming most are used to conceal and protect wiring though I'm sure some also carry water. </p>

				<p>Here we see one of the many pipes fassened to the side of buildings around the city. I never noticed any of these before starting this assighnment but they're really everywhere. </p>

				<h3>Twisty Pipes and Box</h3>
				<p>This one definetly looks to me like it's something eletrical. I love how weird looking all these things are and how people have covered most of them in stickers.</p>

				<h3>The One With the Spikes</h3>
				<p>This one has to be eletrical related seeing as it actually has a warning lable visible through all the stickers. I think this one is really cool because it has this box built around it with spikes on top. Also there's a pretty wide verity of pipes and wires all in this one spot.</p>
